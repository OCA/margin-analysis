This module make the glue between product_cost_incl_bom and
product_price_history and allow to have your cost price computed from the
component of the BoM, while having it also historized by company.

It display now this value for the inventory valuation provided by

Technically speaking, the way function field store the values computed for the
cost_price to store the proper value per date and company in the history table.
