Product Price History
=====================

This module allows you to:

* Record various prices of a same product for different companies. This way,
  every company can have its own costs (average or standard) and sale prices.
* Historize the prices in a way that you'll then be able to retrieve the cost
  (or sale) price at a given date.

Note that to benefit those values in stock report (or any other view that is
based on SQL), you'll have to adapt it to include this new historized
table. Especially true for stock valuation.

This module also contains demo data and various tests to ensure it works
well. It shows how to configure OpenERP properly when you have various company,
each of them having their product setup in average price and using different
currencies. The goal is to share the products between all companies, keeping
the right price for each of them.

As the prices are now historized, some information aren't revelant anymore in
some report. This module also hide the price information in those view to avoid
having wrong informations. Instead you'll find a view that allow you to retrive
the product price and stock at a given date to value your inventory properly.

Technically, this module updates the definition of field standard_price,
list_price of the product and will make them stored in an external table. We
override the read, write and create methods to achieve that and don't used
ir.property for performance and historization purpose.

You may want to also use the module analytic_multicurrency from `bzr branch
lp:account-analytic/7.0` in order to have a proper computation in analytic line
as well (standard_price will be converted in company currency with this module
when computing cost of analytic line).
