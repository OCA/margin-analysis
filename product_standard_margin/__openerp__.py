 'description': """
  Add a field on the product form that compute the standard (or theorical) margin based on the
  current values of sale and cost price present in the product form. We take care of taxe included
  or excluded.

  It will just compute it as follow: (Sale Price without tax - Cost Price) / Sale Price without tax

  Remember that this module can be used in conjonction with product_cost_incl_bom to have the
  cost price computed from the BOM when a product has one.

  WARNING:

  1) As this module will base his simple computation on sale and cost prices, it suppose
  you have them both in the same currency (the price type must of the same currency for both of
  them). Remember this is the default OpenERP configuration (price type of all product price
  fields are set as the same as the company currency). We don't take care of it cause otherwise
  we should have added a dependency on sale module.
