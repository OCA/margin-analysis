* This module will not work for variants that have a not null ``price_extra`` value, due to the poor design of Odoo product module. This issue can be maybe fixed in new version of Odoo.

* Onchanges features will works properly in the product.product form view. In the product.template form view, user have to save the current changes, to see the proposal of the new price displayed.
