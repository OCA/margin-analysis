This module is designed to extend Sale Price computation in Odoo.

This module add a new model 'Margin Classifications' linked to Product
variants.

A margin classification has a 'Profit Margin' field and extra fields to
manage computation method, like in Pricelist Item model (Markup Rate,
Rounding and Surcharge fields)

This module use both
[Markup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markup_(business)) and [Profit
Margin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Profit_margin) concepts.

You could be interested by native Pricelist functionalities, setting
sale prices based on Cost prices. The main problem of this design is
that sale price change automaticaly when cost price changes, that is not
desired in some user cases. For exemple, if you have a shop, you want to
changes sale prices when customers is not in the shop, and after having
changed labels in the shop.

Configuration
=============

-  Go to : 'Sale > Configuration > Products > Margin Classifications
-  Create new classifications
-  Set classification to your products

On the Margin classification Form, user can change computation fields.
(Margin, Rounding method, ...) Three buttons are available to apply
theoretical prices: \* to all products, \* only for products that are
too expensive \* only for products that are too cheap

By clicking on the smart buttons on the right part of the form, all the
products will be displayed, and user can easily change prices

User can also see easily products with incorrect margins in the margin
classification tree views:

Usage
=====

If product has a margin classification defined and the theoretical price
is not the same as the sale price, an extra field 'Theoretical Price' is
displayed, based on the Margin Classification and a button is available
to change sale price.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

-  This module will not work for variants that have a not null
   ``price_extra`` value, due to the poor design of Odoo product module.
   This issue can be maybe fixed in new version of Odoo.
