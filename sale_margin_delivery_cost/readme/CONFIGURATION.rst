On Shipping Methods there is a field to configure them to be
tracked under Other Costs instead of Sales Order Lines.

Navigate to *Sales > Configuration > Sales Orders > Shipping Methods*:

On a *Shipping Method*, set the *Charging Policy* field:

  - "As SO Line" is the standard behaviour
  - "As Other Cost" add the cost as *Other Costs* sale order line.
