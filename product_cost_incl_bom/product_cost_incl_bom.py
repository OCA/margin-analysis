    Recipe from:

    Dependencies are expressed as a dictionary whose keys are items
    and whose values are a set of dependent items. Output is a list of
    sets in topological order. The first set consists of items with no
    dependences, each subsequent set consists of items that depend upon
    items in the preceeding sets.

        """ Compute the purchase price of products

        Take into account the sub products (bills of materials) and the
        routing.

        As an example, we have such a hierarchy of products::

            - Table A
                - 2x Plank 20.-
                - 4x Wood leg 10.-
            - Table B
                - 3x Plank 20.-
                - 4x Red wood leg
            - Red wood leg
                - 1x Wood leg 10.-
                - 1x Red paint pot 10.-
            - Chair
                - 1x Plank
                - 4x Wood leg
            - Table and Chair
                - 1x Table Z
                - 4x Chair Z

        When we update the ``standard_price`` of a "Wood leg", all cost
        prices of the products upper in the tree must be computed again.
        Here, that is: "Table A", "Red wood leg", "Chair", "Table B".
        The price of all theses products are computed at the same
        time in this function, the effect is that we should take:

        1. to not read the cost of a product in the browse_record,
           if it is computed here because it has likely changed, but use
           the new cost instead
        2. compute the prices in a topological order, so we start at the
           leaves of the tree thus we know the prices of all the sub
           products when we go up the tree

        The topological sort, in this example, when we modify the "Wood
        leg", will returns successively 3 generators::

            [set('Wood plank', 'Red Paint Pot', 'Wood Leg')],
            [set('Table A', 'Red wood leg')],
            [set('Table B')]]

        The first set having no dependencies and the subsequent sets
        having items that depend upon items in the preceding set.
